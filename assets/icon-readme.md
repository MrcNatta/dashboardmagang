# Basic icon placeholder
# In production, you would want to create proper icons for different platforms:
# - assets/icon.ico (256x256, Windows)
# - assets/icon.icns (macOS)  
# - assets/icon.png (512x512, Linux)
# 
# For now, the app will use default Electron icons.
# You can add your own icons later by replacing the icon files.
